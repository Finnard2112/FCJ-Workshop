# Automating Security Incident Response with Forensics Integration

### Overall
 In this lab, you'll build a serverless application and learn to protect it by implementing a fully automated incident response system to contain the threat, collect related evidence, create a timeline analysis, and generate a report. The report will then be sent to the subscribed emails. You will implement this using Lambda, EventBridge, StepFunctions, and Amazon SNS
